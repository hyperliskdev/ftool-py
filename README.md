# ftool-py
ftool-rs written in python because rusty_falcon has failed me.



## Usage

Make a copy of `.env.example` named `.env`

Place your CrowdStrike API keys in .env

Use `pipx install -e . --force` to install the program globally

Then run the program with `ftool`, it should be available globally.

Make sure to run the program in the same directory as the `.env`
